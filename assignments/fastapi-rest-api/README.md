# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. Students will create endpoints, handle requests and responses, and understand basic API concepts.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Create a Simple FastAPI Application

#### Description
Set up a FastAPI project and create a basic API with at least two endpoints (e.g., `/hello` and `/items`).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Use FastAPI to create a web server
- Implement a `/hello` endpoint that returns a greeting message
- Implement a `/items` endpoint that returns a list of items (static or dynamic)
- Run locally and respond to HTTP requests

### 🛠️ Add CRUD Operations for Items

#### Description
Expand your API to support Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for items using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Allow clients to add new items (POST)
- Retrieve items (GET)
- Update items (PUT)
- Delete items (DELETE)
- Use request and response models for data validation

### 🛠️ (Optional) Add Extra Features

#### Description
Enhance your API with additional features for learning and practice.

#### Requirements
Completed program could:
- Add error handling and custom responses
- Use query parameters and path parameters
- Document the API using FastAPI's automatic docs
- Store items in memory or a simple database
